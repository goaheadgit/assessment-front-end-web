				<h3>Quotes I Think About All The Time</h3>
				<p>
                    You're a smart person. You can understand subtext in what you said. Let's not feign ignorance or be passive aggressive. You made a comment trying to get a rise out of me. Let's just leave it at that and agree that maybe we don't agree on everything and that's fine. Let's not insult each other's intelligence by pretending we can't understand subtext.
				</p>
				<p>
                    Sometimes you just need 20 seconds of insane courage, and something great will happen.
				</p>
				<p>
                    The secret to life is people. 
				</p>				
                <p>
                    If you assume people are having a hard time, more than half of the time, youâ€™ll be right.
